# Data Cleaning

Welcome to my data cleaning repository! This repository is dedicated to the process of data cleaning, an essential step in any data analysis or machine learning project. Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in datasets to ensure their accuracy and reliability for further analysis.

**Why Data Cleaning Matters:**
Data cleaning is crucial because raw data often contains errors, missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies that can lead to inaccurate conclusions or flawed models. By thoroughly cleaning the data, we can improve its quality, reduce bias, and increase the validity of our analyses.

**Key Steps in Data Cleaning:**
1. **Identify Data Quality Issues:** Assess the dataset for missing values, duplicate entries, incorrect data types, outliers, and other anomalies.
2. **Handle Missing Data:** Determine the best approach for dealing with missing values, such as imputation, deletion, or estimation.
3. **Remove Duplicate Entries:** Identify and remove duplicate rows or records from the dataset.
4. **Correct Data Errors:** Address any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data, such as misspellings or incorrect formatting.
5. **Standardize Data:** Ensure consistency in data format, units, and terminology to facilitate analysis and interpretation.
6. **Handle Outliers:** Evaluate outliers and decide whether to exclude, transform, or correct them based on their impact on the analysis.
7. **Validate Data:** Verify the accuracy and integrity of the cleaned dataset through validation checks and comparisons with external sources.
